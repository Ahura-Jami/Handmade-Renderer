/**
 * Model: The scene which the renderer should render.
 * The “Scene” class is very bare-bones, it contains no member functions whatsoever.
 * Treat this class like a database: It has a bunch of tables in it, the tables contain
 * data that possibly refer to other tables in the database, you can read/write the
 * objects in the tables, and you can insert or erase elements from tables.
 *
 * In a typical renderer, you might have a table of all the materials, a table of all
 * the meshes, a table of all the instances of meshes, a table of all the cameras,
 * and etc.
